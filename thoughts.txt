Use both physical attributes and a neural network.

Use a recurrent neural network with reinforcement learning.
Every node has a memory of previously given values and at each timestep it is polled for activation, which then is sent through each connection.

Put evolutionary pressure on weights, number of hidden neurons and the number of connections.

Inputs:
	
	Sight - Pixel data for a certain number of pixels (raycasting?)
	Energy - Simple counter
	
Output:

	Thrust - Right and left side
